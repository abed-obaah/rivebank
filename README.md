Design Decisions
The design decisions made during the development process were as follows:

React was chosen  because it is widely used and has excellent documentation, making it easier to learn and work with. Additionally, React's virtual DOM allows for efficient rendering
To create a responsive and user friendly interface, we used tailwind CSS responsive and flexbox layout to handle page layout. This approach allowed us to easily align elements both horizontally and vertically within their parent
To create customizable solutions, we utilized Reactâ€™s component-based architecture and allowed users to pass props to modify various elements on the page such as text content, images, colors,no animation was added to the landing page.

React.js for the frontend to leverage its component-based architecture.
CSS Modules for styling to avoid style conflicts and promote modularity.
